    "text": "Introduction\nClinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are tools designed to support clinicians by providing information that may assist in decision-making. These systems can offer diagnostic suggestions, treatment guidelines, or alerts based on a patient’s data, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes and streamlining care.\nWhile CDSS have shown promise in reducing errors, improving adherence to clinical guidelines, and supporting personalised care, the overall impact can vary depending on the specific system and context in which it is used. Some challenges, such as alert fatigue and over-reliance on technology, need to be carefully managed to ensure effective implementation.\nAs CDSS becomes more integrated with electronic health records (EHRs), there is growing interest in refining these tools to maximise their benefits while addressing potential limitations. Ensuring that CDSS is used in a thoughtful and appropriate manner remains essential for optimising its role in modern healthcare.",

    "text": "Digital technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, driving remarkable progress across countless fields. However, while it holds immense potential, its use must be approached with care, especially in healthcare, where the impact can be profound.\nIn the realm of health and care, the stakes are higher than ever. Health Informatics, also known as Clinical Informatics or Medical Informatics, explores how digital systems can transform health management for the better. This guide, The Essentials of Health Informatics, is a comprehensive, open-source resource designed to support everyone—from newcomers to seasoned professionals. Whether you’re just stepping into the field or seeking a go-to reference as an advanced practitioner, this guide covers the full spectrum of health informatics and will be continuously updated to reflect the rapid changes in this evolving discipline.\nComplementing the guide, we offer a series of webinars that delve into core topics in Health Informatics. These will soon be available for viewing.\nReady to dive into the Essentials of Health Informatics? Access the guide here."
