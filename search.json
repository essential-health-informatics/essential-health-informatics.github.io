    "text": "Our aim with this guide is to ensure that the concepts of health informatics are accessible to a broad audience. To aid you in setting the tone of your writings, we ask you to aim the level of your writing at those who have recently completed A-level education or have an equivalent understanding. This means writing in a way that is clear, straightforward, and avoids overly technical jargon. We want to present the material in a way that someone of average intelligence, without a specialised background in technology or healthcare, can understand and engage with the subject.\nWhen writing or reviewing sections of the guide, please keep the following in mind:\n\nSimplify complex ideas: Break down technical terms and concepts into easy-to-understand explanations without oversimplifying or losing key details.\nUse familiar language: Avoid highly technical or academic language where possible, and explain any necessary terms clearly.\nBalance depth and clarity: While we want the guide to be informative, it should not overwhelm the reader with excessive details or complex language. Focus on explaining the core concepts and their relevance.\nRelatable examples: Use relatable examples when possible to help illustrate points. Drawing on everyday technology or scenarios that a general audience would recognise can help demystify abstract ideas.\nExplain abbreviations: All abbreviations or acronyms should be fully explained the first time they are used in each subchapter. This ensures clarity for readers who may not be familiar with specialised terms.\nUse illustration: Where appropriate, use illustrations to help demonstrate your key points. Consider 0-5 illustrations per subchapter, although more may be needed for more complicated or visual topics.\nReference key points: Wherever possible, provide references to support key points, especially for facts, figures, or widely accepted practices. This adds credibility and allows readers to explore topics further if they wish.\nNo plagiarism: Do not copy and paste text from other people’s work unless you specifically state you are quoting this work. In all other cases, write out the concept you are explaining in your own words.\n\nBy adopting this approach, we aim to make the guide not only a useful resource for beginners in health informatics but also an engaging and approachable one for those coming from various educational backgrounds.\n\nTitle case for titles (expand)",

    "text": "Analogue vs. Digital: What are Continuous Signals?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn analogue systems, information is represented using continuous signals. This means that data is stored or transmitted as a smooth, uninterrupted wave, where any value between a minimum and maximum can be represented. For example, an analogue signal can take any value between 0 and 1, including numbers like 0.1, 0.55, or 0.9999. This smooth, continuous variation is how real-world phenomena, like sound, light and data obtained from human subjects, are naturally represented.\nHowever, while analogue systems capture more detail due to this continuity, they are also more prone to distortion or noise. Even small amounts of interference can alter an analogue signal, reducing its reliability.\nIn contrast, digital systems break information down into discrete steps. Rather than storing or transmitting a continuous wave, digital systems sample the data at regular intervals and convert these samples into binary numbers (0s and 1s). For example, instead of recording every point on a smooth wave of sound, a digital system takes many small snapshots of the wave. These snapshots are stored as discrete whole numbers, which makes digital systems more resistant to noise and interference.",

    "section": "Encoding Information",
    "text": "Encoding Information\n\n\n\n\n\nTo turn human-readable information, like letters and pictures, into binary, encoding systems are used. An encoding system is a set of rules or formats that convert data from one form into another—typically from something humans can easily understand, like text or images, into binary, which computers can process.\nFor example, in text encoding systems like ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), each letter, number, or symbol is assigned a unique binary number.\nLet’s take the letter “A” as an example. In the ASCII encoding system, the letter “A” is represented by the decimal number 65. Decimal is the numbering system we use every day, based on ten digits (0-9), while binary is based on only two digits (0 and 1). When you convert this decimal number into binary, it becomes 01000001. So, when you press the letter “A” on your keyboard, the encoding system translates it into the binary sequence 01000001 that the computer can process. This binary sequence is then stored or transmitted as a series of electrical signals that represent 0s and 1s.\nSimilarly, every letter and symbol has its own unique binary code. For example:\n\nThe lowercase “a” is represented by 97 in ASCII, which translates to 01100001 in binary.\nThe space character is represented by 32 in ASCII, which is 00100000 in binary.\n\nThis process allows computers to handle and store text as a series of 0s and 1s, making it possible for digital systems to manipulate and display information.",

It performs all the calculations and tasks required to run software and process data. The CPU is responsible for interpreting instructions from programs and controlling all other components of the system.\n\n\nMemory (RAM)\nRandom Access Memory (RAM) is the temporary storage used by a computer while it is running. RAM stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly. The more RAM a system has, the more data it can handle at once, making it essential for multitasking and running complex applications.\n\n\nStorage Devices\nHard Disk Drive (HDD) and Solid State Drive (SSD) are the primary storage devices in most digital systems. These components store data long-term, even when the system is powered off. While HDDs use spinning disks to read and write data, SSDs use flash memory, which is faster and more reliable.\n\n\nMotherboard\nThe motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all the components of a system. It allows the CPU, memory, storage, and peripheral devices to communicate with each other. The motherboard also houses essential chips that control the system’s basic functions.\n\n\nInput Devices\nThese are devices that allow users to interact with the system. Examples include keyboards, mice, scanners, and microphones. In healthcare, specialised input devices, such as barcode scanners or digital stethoscopes, are often used to input patient data.\n\n\nOutput Devices\nOutput devices allow the system to communicate with the user by displaying or transmitting information. Examples include monitors, printers, and speakers. In healthcare, output devices can include displays for medical imaging or monitors that show patient data.\n\n\nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU)\nThe GPU is responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations. While traditionally used in gaming and multimedia, GPUs are increasingly important in healthcare applications, such as medical imaging and data visualisation, where high-quality rendering is required.\n\n\nNetwork Interface Card (NIC)\nThe NIC enables a computer to connect to a network, whether it’s a local network or the internet. In healthcare settings, NICs are essential for communication between systems, such as electronic health record systems and diagnostic tools.",

    "section": "Types of Software",
    "text": "Types of Software\nSoftware is generally divided into three broad categories: system software, application software, and utility software. Each plays a unique role in enabling a computer system to function effectively.\n\nSystem Software\nSystem software manages the basic functions of a computer or device and allows the hardware to communicate with other software. It acts as the interface between the hardware and the user, ensuring that resources like memory and processing power are allocated efficiently. The most common type of system software is the Operating System (OS), which serves as the foundation for all other software on a device. The OS handles fundamental tasks such as file management, memory management, and controlling peripheral devices like printers or external drives.\nExamples: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android.\nFunctionality: The OS provides a platform for application software to run. It manages the computer’s resources, including memory, processor time, and storage space, and ensures that these resources are used effectively. Without system software, users wouldn’t be able to install or use application software or interact with the hardware in a meaningful way. The OS also acts as a bridge between the user and the machine, translating user commands into actions that the hardware can execute.\n\n\nApplication Software\nApplication software is designed to perform specific tasks for the user, such as creating documents, browsing the internet, or editing images. Applications sit on top of the system software and depend on it to function, but their focus is on helping the user accomplish a particular goal. Application software is varied and covers everything from basic productivity tools to advanced design and analysis software.\nExamples: Microsoft Word, Google Chrome, Adobe Photoshop.\nFunctionality: Applications allow users to complete specific tasks. These tasks can be as simple as typing a document or as complex as editing a high-definition video. Application software is what most people interact with directly on a daily basis, as it provides the tools needed for activities such as communication, entertainment, and productivity. Applications are often designed with user-friendly interfaces, making it easy for people to use them without needing to understand the technical details of how they work.\n\n\nUtility Software\nUtility software is designed to help maintain and optimise a system’s performance. While system software provides the basic environment for running applications, utility software focuses on enhancing that environment by providing specialised tools for managing, securing, and optimising the system. It operates in the background, ensuring that the system runs smoothly by performing tasks like cleaning up disk space, organising files, or protecting the system from security threats.\nExamples: Antivirus programs, file compression tools, disk clean-up utilities.\nFunctionality: Utility software focuses on improving system performance and keeping it running efficiently. These tools often come bundled with the operating system, but many are also available as standalone applications. Utility software can scan for malware, defragment a hard drive, back up important files, or recover deleted data. It plays a crucial role in extending the life and efficiency of a digital system by ensuring that everything is running as smoothly and securely as possible.\n\n\nOthers\nIn addition to system, application, and utility software, other specialised types include embedded software for specific devices like medical equipment, and real-time software for processing data instantly in time-sensitive environments. Firmware manages low-level hardware functions, while virtualization and containerization software enable multiple systems or applications to run on a single machine. Enterprise software supports large-scale business operations, and cloud-based applications provide scalable services accessed remotely. Mobile applications are designed for use on smartphones and tablets. These software types serve unique roles, enhancing the functionality and efficiency of digital systems.",

These systems can offer diagnostic suggestions, treatment guidelines, or alerts based on a patient’s data, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes and streamlining care.\nWhile CDSSs have shown promise in reducing errors, improving adherence to clinical guidelines, and supporting personalised care, the overall impact can vary depending on the specific system and context in which it is used. Some challenges, such as alert fatigue and over-reliance on technology, need to be carefully managed to ensure effective implementation.\nAs CDSS becomes more integrated with electronic patient records (EPRs), there is growing interest in refining these tools to maximise their benefits while addressing potential limitations.
