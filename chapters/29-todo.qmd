## To do

### Technical

- Single image added to the front matter of each chapter with alt and verticalPosition. This is then used to create the banner in a 3:1 ratio.
- Selenium.
- Student and seasoned professional content access/switch. Needs some more research into how this needs to work for the end-user.
- Convert banner.ts privates to protected and change tests to mimic chapters.test.ts.
- Add protected methods to the timeline-main.ts class. Update tests to reflect this, using class extension.
- Finish banner testing (pre-render)
- Finish non-200 link testing (post-render)
- Test all pages have a banner at the top, before any text. Banners need to be of 3:1 ratio (width:height), except on index pages and timelines.
- Check all titles are in `Title case`. How to handle acronyms and words that are capitalized in the middle of a sentence?
- All chapter folders and subfolders must have an `index.qmd` file. Needs unit testing and checking in chapters.ts.
- Bibliography for each chapter???
